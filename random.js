var lyric = ['A purple pig and a green donkey flew a kite in the middle of the night and ended up sunburnt','If the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy had babies would they take your teeth and leave chocolate for you?','Wednesday is hump day, but has anyone asked the camel if he’s happy about it?','Where do random thoughts come from?','The clock within this blog and the clock on my laptop are 1 hour different from each other','I currently have 4 windows open up… and I don’t know why','I want to buy a onesie… but know it won’t suit me','When I was little I had a car door slammed shut on my hand. I still remember it quite vividly'];
